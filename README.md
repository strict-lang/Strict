## Strict is a language computers can understand

Strict is a simple-to-understand programming language that not only humans can read and understand, but also computer AI is able to read, modify and write. It has backends for many common frameworks like JDK, .NET and allows you to generate C++, C#, Java, etc. code or run in its own VM.

## Language Server Protocol

This repository was started 2020-06-16 just for experimentation to create editor plugins and rethinking some of the low level parsing, using the [old Strict sdk](https://github.com/strict-lang/sdk) as a guide.

The LSP (Language Server Protocol) implementation here adds support for VSCode, VS2019, IntelliJ and many more IDEs as possible Editors for Strict.
