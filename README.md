## Strict is a language computers can understand

Strict is a simple-to-understand programming language that not only humans can read and understand, but also computers are able to understand, modify and write it.

The long term goal is NOT to create just another programming language, but use Strict as the foundation for a higher level language for computers to understand and write code. This is the first step towards a future where computers can write their own code, which is the ultimate goal of Strict. Again, this is very different from other programming languages that are designed for humans to write code, but not for computers to understand it (even though LLMs can be trained to repeat and immitate, which is amazing to see, they still don't understand anything really and make the most ridicoulous mistakes on any project bigger than a handful of files). Strict needs to be very fast, both in execution and writing code (much faster than any existing system) so millions of lines of code can be thought of by computers and be evaluated in real time (seconds).

## Language Server Protocol

The LSP (Language Server Protocol) implementation here adds support for VSCode, VS2019, IntelliJ and many more IDEs as possible Editors for Strict.

## History

The idea to write my (Benjamin Nitschke, now CEO of Delta Engine) own programming language originally started in the 1990s. Due to lack of time and skill wasn't really much more than a bunch of small programs and proof of concept ideas. In 2008-2010 the first iteration was build and while it worked, it lacked integration and was discarded in favor of Lua. This repository was started 2020-06-16 just for experimentation to create editor plugins and rethinking some of the low level parsing, using the [old Strict sdk](https://github.com/strict-lang/sdk) as a guide. In mid 2025 I am back working on it alone after a few years of pause while I had some help in 2020-2022 from some employees, in the end the project direction for creating neural networks and do image processing was abandoned. There were too many ready to use solutions to compete against and the project ran out of funding and man power.
