# Improvements
What to fix next, one short line each, bugs first. Remove a line once it is done, add what is found at the end. No history or measurements (those go into commit messages). Speed work: [performance.md](performance.md).

## Bugs
- Native code keeps the 64 bit value of a member with `value.Bits is 32` (`Perturbation(..., -0.0005, ...)`), the VM rounds it on construction (`Rounding.Members`); WebGPU rounds such inputs itself.

## Next
- GPU speed and memory: [improvements-gpu.md](improvements-gpu.md); Ternary Bonsai and Qwen3.8-Flash-Next: [improvements-models.md](improvements-models.md).
- Game engine (iOS, Android, one game loop, Spine, platform services): [improvements-engine.md](improvements-engine.md).
- Nightly CI: build and run every program's Run once a day (games and long running apps for a few frames); work too slow for a Slow test (rebuilding all content, big models) belongs in a Run, not in tests.
- Networking: `Http.Send`, `Http.Started`/`Received` and `Hmac.Sha256` are in (Windows, Linux and the web checked, macOS untested), DeltaEngine's Google sign-in and sheet downloads use them: switch Rebalancing's `NativeIO.Http`/`Hmac` (with the user, it trades live); client certificates when a program needs them, TLS for multiplayer sockets later.
- GPU sidecars: every program still keeps Name.kernels.mlir (the PTX cache key) and test executables their PTX next to the source, move them into Tools/PtxCache once it evicts old entries (up to 25 MB each, never cleaned today).
- f32 kernels: a loop reading a `value.Bits is 32` member runs as a WGSL shader on WebGPU in web builds (`WgslShader`), CUDA still computes it in f64 (or the exact-only f32 variant); WGSL lacks Sin, Cos, Logarithm, `from` calls, Bytes results and rows.

## Waiting
- Later: Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B-A3B and Qwen3-Coder-30B with all experts, image blur on the GPU, Apple Silicon, AMD GPUs, batched training ideas.
