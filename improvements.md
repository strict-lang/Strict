# Improvements
What to fix next, one short line each, bugs first. Remove a line once it is done, add what is found at the end. No history or measurements (those go into commit messages). Speed work: [performance.md](performance.md).

## Bugs
- `Compiler/MlirWholeTypes` fails 4 tests (Halving.Part(0) gives "iiii-" instead of "iiii", Settled, Initial, Step), also with the committed sources of 51b1ac23 (a cached .strictbinary hid it).

## Next
- GPU speed and memory: [improvements-gpu.md](improvements-gpu.md); Ternary Bonsai and Qwen3.8-Flash-Next: [improvements-models.md](improvements-models.md).
- Game engine (iOS, Android, one game loop, Spine, platform services): [improvements-engine.md](improvements-engine.md).
- Nightly CI: build and run every program's Run once a day (games and long running apps for a few frames); work too slow for a Slow test (rebuilding all content, big models) belongs in a Run, not in tests.
- Networking: `Http.Send`, `Http.Started`/`Received` and `Hmac.Sha256` are in (Windows, Linux and the web checked, macOS untested), DeltaEngine's Google sign-in and sheet downloads use them: switch Rebalancing's `NativeIO.Http`/`Hmac` (with the user, it trades live); client certificates when a program needs them, TLS for multiplayer sockets later.

## Waiting
- Later: Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B-A3B and Qwen3-Coder-30B with all experts, image blur on the GPU, Apple Silicon, AMD GPUs, batched training ideas.
